\section{Expectations and Experiments}

One of the aims with this project is to create a model that is able
to learn how to play an arbitrary atari game as long as the
dimensions of the frames are upholding the specifications from section \ref{Data}.
These specifications are naturally present in the game environments that are available
in the OpenAI Gym framework, since the method is created with this framework in mind.
Another important property of this model is that we should be able to see a 
Thus, the hypothesis is that we 


use the asynchronous update scheme
of A3C to increase the decreae variance of learning.
