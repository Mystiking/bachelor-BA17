\section{Markov Properties/Processes}

The Markov process is a process where the future events, is independent of the events happened earlier, given the current state. KOM MED REFERENCE
\\ \\
In reinforcement learning the agent makes its decisions by the states from the environment. In a reinforcement learning algorithm the property is satisfied, if the decision of what action to take at time $t$, is chosen only by looking at the environment states to time $t$.
\\ \\
So the state signal have to include some data to decide which future actions to take, the state signal is said have the Markov property if its retaining all relevant information from the past.
