### Problemformuleringer

#### Forslag 1

In this project we will compare the DQN and A3C algorithms for
learning Atari 2600 games, and investigate advantages and disadvantages
with both methods.
We will also compare the A3C algorithm with itself, using a different
amount of threads.

_The A3C algorithm will be partially implemented, but the DQN algorithm is
from a library._

#### Forslag 2

In this project we will investigate the adaptability of the A3C algorithm
by using it on a "side-scroller", instead of Atari 2600 games.
We will partially implement the algorithm and compare it to results from
"artikel om A3C" and with the performance of a human player.
